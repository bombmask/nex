* This library was created because I wanted a library to create games with. I have developed with many different libraries and every one seems to lack in one area or another. 
* Thus this project was born to fill my need for a good library that supports 2d and 3d games.

* This project has very high goals set some of which may never be met but this is a project that I really want to make work.

* Here are some of the goals for this library:
    - Provide an easy to use interface which anyone can understand.
